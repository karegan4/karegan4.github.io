I am the youngest in my family and the most tech-savvy. I’ve always been my family’s “go-to” technology fixer. I’ve always been a bit addicted to figuring out how computers work. I once took apart a Sony Vaio computer, bought spare parts online, and put it back together again. I taught myself how to convert VHS tapes into virtual files. I also taught myself how to code (basic CSS, Swift and I’ve dabbled in Java, C# and HTML). To do this, I took advantage of free online resources and programmed my own apps, Unity games, and created simple (but functional) websites. I love learning new things.
For the past 6 years, I worked as a middle school Spanish teacher in the NYS school system. I am not a native Spanish speaker. I learned Spanish in high school, in college, and studied and lived abroad in Spain for 3 years. While my Spanish language education was immensely important, there is nothing like full immersion in a Spanish-speaking country when it comes to truly learning a language. 
Coding is a language, and I am good at learning languages. I believe that if you want something badly enough, and if you have a true passion for it, nothing should stand in your way (as corny as that sounds). I have a passion for learning languages and learning how to code.
Three years ago, I was forced to take a medical leave due to a cancer diagnosis, which left me with a lot of free time. I took up coding and immediately fell in love with learning how to use my creativity and design programs and apps. I bought courses on Udemy and StackSkills. I signed up for Treehouse Coding and utilized their resources to help me along the way. I used YouTube videos for what I couldn't find elsewhere. I re-learned what I already knew: full immersion is best. 
I knew that in order to fully reach my potential as a coder, I would need a program with structure, leadership and instructors to help guide me, expand my knowledge and help me understand coding from the basics. This led me to the Flatiron Coding school. 
While learning on my own has been beneficial, I’ve hit certain points in my journey that made me question why certain code worked how it did. Copying and pasting code, while often functional, isn’t truly learning. I want to know how it works, why it works, and be able to incorporate and expand it into projects that I’ve designed myself (and in the specific way I’d like it to be).
I am truly excited to take on this endeavor and look forward to taking full advantage of everything that this program has to offer.
